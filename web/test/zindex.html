<h4>Header Z-Index = 2</h4>
<p>You probably can't read this part, so I will fill it in with useless text for 
the time being.  This paragraph has a z-index of 1, which is less than
the header.  As you can see, the header has been moved down, using positioning, and is
now resting on top of this paragraph.  If we had not defined the z-index, by default the paragraph
would have been on top of the header because it appears later in our HTML code.</p>
